    <h2>Car detection</h2>
    <p>
        Our project revolves around the development of a car detection system
        aimed at detecting and addressing breaking traffic rules. Leveraging
        advanced computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques, our
        system identifies vehicles within a given traffic scene and analyzes
        their behavior in real-time. Through the integration of cameras or
        sensors at strategic locations, our solution monitors illegal lane
        changes. The system alerts authorities or relevant stakeholders instantly
        upon detecting a violation, facilitating swift intervention and
        enforcement of traffic regulations.
