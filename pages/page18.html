    <h2>POS mobile application</h2>
    <p>
        Our university software project focused on developing a Point of Sale
        (POS) system tailored for mobile devices. The POS application aimed to
        streamline transactions and inventory management for small businesses by
        providing a user-friendly interface accessible via smartphones or
        tablets. Through innovative features such as real-time sales tracking
        and inventory updates, our solution aimed to enhance operational
        efficiency and customer service for retailers on-the-go.

        really didn’t care about school for
        some time — until he reached the 4th grade, and had Imogene “Teddy” Hill
        as a teacher.</p>
